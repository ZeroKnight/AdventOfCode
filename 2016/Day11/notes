### Rules

 * Elevator MUST have at least one microchip or generator to move

 * Max 2 items on the elevator at one time

 * Elevator stops at each floor to recharge, each stop counts as 1 move

 * A chip will fry if it stops on the same floor as an RTG, UNLESS it will end
   up on the same floor as its corresponding RTG

### Optimizations:

 * ~~If a lower floor is empty, don't try to move anything back down to it~~

    + Not doing this actually earned me significantly faster runtime. Part 1 was
      50% faster, and Part 2 was 74% faster!

 * Keep track of previously visited states and don't follow them again

   + Zobrist Hashing is a cheap and fast way to hash a "game" state

   + **KEY**: Pairs of differing elements are all **equivalent**!
     (HG@f1, HM@f2) and (LiG@f1, LiM@f2) are interchangeable and thus equivalent
     states which can be pruned. You could use either state and end up with the
     same number of moves.

 * Whenever possible, move 2 items UP instead of 1, and 1 item DOWN instead of 2

### Other Notes:

 * Generators can safely be moved to floors with other generators

 * Chips can safely be moved to floors with zero or more chips
